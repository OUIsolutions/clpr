### Overview

CLPR (Command Line Process Runner) is an advanced Lua library designed for orchestrating and managing parallel processes. It provides a powerful framework for executing asynchronous operations, managing their lifecycle, and retrieving results in a controlled manner:

1. **Define reusable actions**
2. **Execute actions in parallel**
3. **Monitor process status**
4. **Wait for completion with timeouts**
5. **Retrieve and manage results**

This library is designed for developers who need to:
- Execute long-running tasks in parallel
- Orchestrate complex multi-step workflows
- Manage process lifecycles automatically
- Handle asynchronous operations with ease
- Build robust command-line tools and automation scripts

---

### System Architecture

The CLPR library uses a process-based architecture where:
- **Orchestrator**: Manages the overall workflow and process coordination
- **Actions**: Reusable functions that can be executed asynchronously
- **Action Instances**: Running processes that can be monitored and controlled
- **Communication**: File-based inter-process communication for results

---

### Key Features

- **Parallel Process Execution** - Run multiple actions simultaneously
- **Action Management** - Define reusable actions with callbacks
- **Process Monitoring** - Check if processes are alive and healthy
- **Result Retrieval** - Get return values from completed actions
- **Timeout Handling** - Wait for completion with configurable timeouts
- **Automatic Cleanup** - Built-in resource management and process cleanup
- **Flexible Dependencies** - Pluggable functions for file operations and process management

### Supported Operations

- **Action Definition** - Create reusable action templates
- **Parallel Execution** - Start multiple actions simultaneously
- **Process Control** - Kill, monitor, and manage running processes
- **Result Management** - Retrieve and handle action results
- **Error Handling** - Robust error handling with timeouts
- **Resource Cleanup** - Automatic cleanup of temporary resources

## Quick Example

```lua
local dtw = require("luaDoTheWorld/luaDoTheWorld")
local clpr = require("clpr")

-- Create orchestrator
local orchestrator = clpr.newOrchestrator({
    args = arg,
    database_path = ".clpr",
    write_file = dtw.write_file,
    remove_dir = dtw.remove_any,
    load_file = dtw.load_file,
    dumper = dtw.serialize_var,
    loader = dtw.interpret_serialized_var,
    get_pid = dtw.get_pid,
    is_pid_alive = dtw.is_pid_alive,
    kill_process_by_pid = dtw.kill_process,
})

-- Define an action
orchestrator.add_action({
    name = "heavy_task",
    callback = function(args)
        os.execute("sleep " .. args.duration)
        return args.value * 2
    end
})

-- Main execution
orchestrator.add_main(function()
    -- Start parallel actions
    local task1 = orchestrator.start_action("heavy_task", {value = 10, duration = 2})
    local task2 = orchestrator.start_action("heavy_task", {value = 20, duration = 3})
    
    -- Wait for completion
    task1.wait(10, function() os.execute("sleep 1") end)
    task2.wait(10, function() os.execute("sleep 1") end)
    
    -- Get results
    print("Task 1 result: " .. task1.get_result()) -- 20
    print("Task 2 result: " .. task2.get_result()) -- 40
end)
```
